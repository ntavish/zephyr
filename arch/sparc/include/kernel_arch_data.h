/**
 * @brief Sparc Standard Stack Frame
 *
 * From The SPARC Architecture Manual Version 8
 *
 * The following are always allocated at compile time in every
 * procedure’s stack frame:
 *
 * - 16 words, always starting at %sp, for saving the procedure’s in
 *   and local registers, should a register window overflow occur
 *
 * The following are allocated at compile time in the stack frames of
 * non-leaf procedures:
 *
 * - One word, for passing a “hidden” (implicit) parameter. This is
 *   used when the caller is expecting the callee to return a data
 *   aggregate by value; the hidden word contains the address of stack
 *   space allocated (if any) by the caller for that purpose See
 *   Section D.4.
 *
 * - Six words, into which the callee may store parameters that must
 *   be addressable
 *
 * The stack pointer %sp must always be doubleword-aligned. This
 * allows window overflow and underflow trap handlers to use the more
 * efficient STD and LDD instructions to store and reload register
 * windows.
